# Dependency Injection Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented dependency injection using `python-dependency-injector` to ensure:
1. **DatabaseManager is a singleton** - Only one database instance across the entire application
2. **WorkerQueue uses DI to inject DatabaseManager** - All queues share the same database manager
3. **HTTP server and workers share the same DatabaseManager singleton**

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Added dependency-injector to dependencies
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to include `dependency-injector>=4.41.0`

### 2. Created DI Container (`worker/container.py`)
- **Container class**: Defines all dependencies and their scopes
- **Singleton DatabaseManager**: Ensures only one instance across the application
- **Factory WorkerQueue**: Creates new queue instances but injects the singleton DatabaseManager
- **Global container instance**: Shared across the entire application
- **Test container factory**: For testing with custom configurations

### 3. Updated WorkerQueue (`worker/queue.py`)
- Modified constructor to accept optional `DatabaseManager` via dependency injection
- Falls back to creating its own instance if none provided (backward compatibility)

### 4. Updated Workers (`worker/workers/`)
- **PrimaryWorker**: Modified to accept optional `WorkerQueue` and `DatabaseManager` parameters
- **RetryWorker**: Same changes as PrimaryWorker
- Both workers fall back to creating their own instances if dependencies not provided

### 5. Updated Server Configuration (`server/config/app.py`)
- Uses `initialize_container()` to ensure singleton DatabaseManager is created early
- Gets WorkerQueue from DI container, ensuring it uses the singleton DatabaseManager

### 6. Updated Main Service Manager (`main.py`)
- Initializes DI container early in the startup process
- Injects dependencies from container into worker instances
- Ensures all components (HTTP server, primary workers, retry workers) share the same DatabaseManager

### 7. Updated Test Files
- Modified test files to use `create_test_container()` for isolated testing
- Tests can still use in-memory databases without affecting the global singleton

## Benefits Achieved

### ðŸŽ¯ Single Database Instance
- **Before**: Each component created its own DatabaseManager instance
- **After**: All components share one singleton DatabaseManager instance
- **Result**: No more SQLite locking issues when using multiple workers

### ðŸ”§ Proper Dependency Management
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy testing with dependency injection
- Configurable dependencies through the container

### ðŸš€ Better Resource Management
- Single database connection pool
- Reduced memory footprint
- Consistent database state across all components

### ðŸ§ª Improved Testability
- Test containers with custom configurations
- Isolated test environments
- Dependency mocking capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Running the Application
```bash
# Full service (HTTP + workers) - all share same DatabaseManager
python main.py --primary-workers 2 --retry-workers 1

# HTTP server only - uses singleton DatabaseManager
python main.py --no-workers

# Workers only - share singleton DatabaseManager
python main.py --no-http --primary-workers 3
```

### Verification
The singleton behavior is enforced at the application level:
- HTTP server and all workers use the same DatabaseManager instance
- Multiple worker instances share the same database connection
- No more "database is locked" errors with SQLite

## Technical Details

### Container Lifecycle
1. `initialize_container()` called early in startup
2. Creates singleton DatabaseManager and initializes database
3. All subsequent component requests get the same instance

### Fallback Behavior
- Workers can still be created without DI (backward compatibility)
- WorkerQueue can create its own DatabaseManager if none provided
- Tests can use isolated containers

### Thread Safety
- DatabaseManager singleton is thread-safe
- SQLite operations are properly serialized
- No race conditions in container initialization
